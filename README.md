Learning Space
-------------------

This repo contains the code for all things that I'm teaching in my [Blog Mineração de Dados](http://mineracaodedados.wordpress.com), or personal demonstrations about some technologies that I'm using. You can use all the code in your favorite IDE. I checked every piece of code here, and the main objective that I have in this space is share reliable and reproductive information.

There's a LOT of things about Data Mining, Statistics, Machine Learning and so on... 


Folders
--------------------

Here's a high level overview of my repos:


* [Datasets](https://github.com/fclesio/learning-space/tree/master/Datasets): Some small datasets for playing with algoritms. There are `.csv`, `.arff`, `.txt` files and so on. 

* [Python](https://github.com/fclesio/learning-space/tree/master/Python): Some scripts in Python for Machine Learning problems and some indistinct sripts. 

* [R](https://github.com/fclesio/learning-space/tree/master/R): All of my projects in R. There are a few scripts about Statistics, and a lot scripts about Machine Learning. 

* [T-SQL](https://github.com/fclesio/learning-space/tree/master/T-SQL): Proundly I was (an accidental) Database Administrator (DBA) in some point of my carrer, and there some scripts that saved me.  

* [H2O.ai](https://github.com/fclesio/learning-space/tree/master/h2o): In this folder I store some scripts that I use in H2O.ai platform. This is a misc repo that will contains scripts of R and Python that runs in H2O.ai. 

* [Lightning Talk @Movile - ML with Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/fclesio/learning-space/tree/master/Lightning%20Talk%20%40Movile%20-%20ML%20with%20Scikit-Learn): A notebook of some presentation that I gave in Movile. 

* [Misc](https://github.com/fclesio/learning-space/tree/master/Misc): My CV, and other files. 


External Setup
--------------------

I all code here are reproducible but some errors can be found. To avoid some of this errors, I strongly recommend the use of this tools.

* [R](https://www.r-project.org) + [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 
* [IPython Notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html)
* [Sublime Text 3](www.sublimetext.com)
* [H2O.ai](www.h2o.ai/download) (Always de last version)
* [InteliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
